## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

The SuperLearner list was very straightforward.  The overarching idea that resonated with me the most was the idea of always having a growth mindset.  All 6 points center around that idea.  I would add "Practice makes Perfect" as a self-explanatory heading.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.

Variables = Objects in programming languages used for storing bits of information.  They come in the following types:

Integers = Whole number data points.

Floats = Number data points containing decimals.

Strings = Data points that are stored in a way where they can be outputted as words or sentences.

Booleans = Data points that can take on one of two forms, true or false.

Bonus: Arrays = Variables that hold multiple of the aforementioned data points of the same type.

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?

var greeting = "Hello World!";
console.log(greeting);

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?

Two forward slashes, //, are used for making code comments.  They are used for providing written context for code, taking notes, temporarily removing sections of code not in use, and are generally used for enhancing the immediate understandability of the code.

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?

A variable is like an empty glass.  You can use it to hold several different drinks temporarily.  You can only fill it with one type of drink at a time, but you are allowed to empty it and fill it for whatever you need it for.  Except instead of holding a drink, a variable holds data like a glass holds a drink.

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?

I use Instagram a lot.  userName is probably a variable used for holding the current username as a string.  loggedIn is probably a variable set to true or false depending on the usage status of the user.  NumberOfUsersOnline is probably an variable used for showing an integer representing the number of your friends online.

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.

Concatenation is the process by which variables are strung together using a + sign much in the same way that a + sign is used for adding numbers.  However, the output will be a combined string of text, rather than a number outputted from a mathematical operation.

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatenation?

Whenever a customized message appears, such as "Welcome, Rory!" on my old AOL email, concatenation is probably used to combine a variable containing my name with the proper string of text.

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)

I would like to know why nobody scanned these lessons and files for typos before pushing these lessons out.
