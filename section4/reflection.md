## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?

I am a big fan of the Pomodoro technique.  I've modified it to match my current work style as follows.  I like taking small timed breaks as needed, I don't mind letting the time I spend working vary.  In general, I prefer to divide my work by tasks and take time breaks in between.  When I do that, I prefer to only take breaks during a task when the task has me stumped.

1. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?

I liked setting intentions.  However, I did not like having the alarm interrupt me while I was still completing my task.  Setting the intention helped me focus, but the random alarm was distracting.

1. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?

An Object is a variable with a collection of varying sub-variables called properties.  These variables can be used to store different properties that can be modified by object methods.  An array variable contains a list of elements only, without any corresponding property variables.  

1. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class

  An array would be used best here because you want just store a list of names without using those names as variables.

  * List of states and their capitals

  Using an object called states, you could create an object instance for each state with a variable for each capital.  That way, if the state changes its capital, you could easily update it with a method.  Also, you could very easily connect the state with the capital without having to have an alternating list of states and capitals like you would if you tried to use an array.

  * List of things to pack for vacation

  An array would be used best here because you just need to create a list of all of things to take on your trip.

  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow

  An array would be used best here because the account names can be saved as a list of data points without needing additional variables for other aspects of the Instagram accounts.

  * List of student names and their cohort

  An array would be used best here because you could set each cohort as a variable and then list the students as elements in the array.  Then a single function could print out the student names with the cohort name derived from the variable itself.

  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake

  Using an object called cake, you could store individual ingredients, as well as the amounts of the individual ingredients as variables.  Using a cake class, you could use the same template for any other cake recipe.  Additionally, you could easily update the recipe whenever you want to with a method and save it accordingly.

  * All my favorite restaurants

  An array would be used best because a list of your favorite restaurants could be easily generated as a list of strings.  Additionally, the place of each restaurant in the array could be used for ranking your favorite restaurants.

1. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties a bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?

All e-commerce platforms have a cart feature that let's you track items you've selected to buy, modify the quantity to purchase, modify the type to purchase, etcetera.  All of these features could be tracked with an object with different keys for each of the individual things mentioned.  The items in your cart would be represented by an array of strings or serial numbers or both, the quantity to purchase would be represented by integers for each item, and the type would be represented by a list of strings. Additionally, profile information, payment and billing information, and purchase history can all be saved as individual keys in this system as well.

1. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?

The terminology from this lesson was confusing.  I would really like to have a diagram of all of the components taught in this lesson labeled clearly and defined off to the side.  Would it be possible to get such a thing?
