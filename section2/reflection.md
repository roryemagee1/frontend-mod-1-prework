## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

I don't have a problem asking questions because I've embarrassed myself so many times in my life, I'm completely numb to the experience now.  I tend to ask questions too soon because I'm impatient with getting to the answer sometimes.

1. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?

I loved jumping right into things and having to figure them out for myself.  It was fun!  I felt comfortable doing it because I've done a little programing before.  I like the feeling of teaching myself things, so it supported my learning by making it more enjoyable.

1. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.

A conditional statement is a statement where a sufficient condition is defined.  If that condition is true, then a necessary condition is executed.  If the sufficient condition is false, then it is possible for the necessary condition to be executed, but it must be executed by different sufficient condition.

Ex: Any login
    If the user is online, display the user as available to all other users.  Else, show them as offline.

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.

You can add multiple conditions to an "if" statement by following it up with "if else" statements.  The computer will start by evaluating the if statement.  If it is true, it will execute its corresponding line of code.  However, if it is false, it will move onto evaluating the following "if else" statement.  If that statement is true, it will execute its corresponding line of code.  If it is false, the computer will move onto the next "if else" statement.  It will continue this process until it arrives at a true "if else" statement or until it arrives at an "else" statement, which will execute a final line of code for all cases not specified by the previous statements.

Ex:  if temperature <= 32, print "It's freezing!",
      else if temperature >= 32 && temperature < 60, print "It's cold."
      else if temperature >= 60 && temperature < 80, print "It's nice out."
      else, print "It's hot!"

1. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?

The "&&" conditional operator can be used for evaluating whether it is true that two conditions are both met. If both conditions are true, the output will be true.  However, if one or both of the conditions are false, the output will be false.

The "||" conditional operator can be used for evaluating whether at least one of two conditions are true.  If one or both conditions are true, the output will be true.  However, if both conditions are false, the output will be false.

1. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?

I want to know what other logical statements can be used in JavaScript beyond if.
